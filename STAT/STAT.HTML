Data are everywhere. Statistics is the science of data interpretation, of using data to arrive at informed, intelligent decisions. Data are just the raw material of knowledge; being a statistician means having the ability to extract, synthesize, and communicate meaning from the sea of data that surrounds us in our information-saturated world. From astronomy; biology; economics; social science; education; public health; psychology; medicine; sports; and marketing; statisticians are relied on to advance the state of knowledge in the field. As statistician John Tukey put it, “The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone else’s back yard.”

And another best thing about being a statistician? Employers want you! According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for individuals with a background is statistics is projected to grow. Employment of statisticians is projected to increase 27% percent from 2012 to 2022, much faster than the average job. This growth is expected to result from more widespread use of statistical analysis to make informed business, healthcare, and policy decisions. Furthermore, an increasing number of positions are available for those with only a bachelor’s level training.
