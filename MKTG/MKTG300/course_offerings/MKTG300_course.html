Principles of Marketing provides a market-oriented perspective to business decision-making. Market-oriented decision-making utilizes concepts, frameworks and processes to understand buyers, competitors, and the marketing environment in order to select target markets and develop the company's value proposition. Core marketing decisions involve developing and managing the product, pricing, distributing and communicating the offer to the marketplace. Successful marketing results in customer satisfaction and loyalty while accomplishing the company's sales and profit objectives. Incorporating multiple perspectives of stakeholders with an explicit customer focus characterizes marketing's role in producing ethical and responsible business decisions.
